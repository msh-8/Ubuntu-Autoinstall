# Overview

The project goal is to provide a flexible and as simple as possible configuration for unattended OS installation via ISO file for Ubuntu linux distribution. 
It was designed to prepare Ubuntu Autoinstall file(cloud-init) and can be used by professional system administrators or for development/testing/education purposes.
The Ansible playbooks contain ready to use installation templates for various methods.

# Features

Templates for unattended installation included in the playbook:
* Embeded cloud-init file on the ISO file.(make ISO file per each change.)
* Cloud-init file over http web server.(make ISO once and change cloud-init file on-demand.)

# Caveats

and have a base knowledge about autoinstall files for the required OS: 
* Cloud-init documents: [Cloud-init Docs](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
* Curtin documents: [curtinâ€™s documentation](https://curtin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) ( for storage, network, apt, etc, configurations )
* BOOTP/DHCP client for klibc: [klibc/klibc.git](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/libs/klibc/klibc.git/tree/usr/kinit/ipconfig/README.ipconfig) ( for setting static ip address in boot )
